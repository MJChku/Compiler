COMP3235 A3 C5C & NAS
============================================================

c5c - compiler -> [make c5c]
nas - the New Assembler-Simulator for a simulated stack machine [make nas]

Example programs:

max.sc            - get maximum of two numbers
fact.sc           - factorial
recursive-fact.sc - recursive factorial
rev-c.sc          - recursive reverse characters of string
demo.sc           - demo of some features

To make c5c and nas:

    make makeall 
    
To remake c5c and nas:

    make remake

To make all testing programs:

    make testall
    
To clear everyting generated:

    make cleanall
    
Note:
1.  Functions search variables in all the stacks that are alive.
    
2.  If argument variable collision occurs in function, the outer variable will
    not be modified.
    
3.  Functions can be defined in different scopes, and can only be called when it
    is alive, just like variables.
    
4.  Register in is used to support void functions
